- This was a student project where we were tasked with creating a hospital triage app using html, css, JavaScript, Express, and our choice of database. This one used MySQL. The project had a limited scope,
so the functionality of different parts of the app were combined, but this will will be addressed in future iterations.<br><br>
- This page shows the triage patient tracker that a staff member would see.<br><br>
