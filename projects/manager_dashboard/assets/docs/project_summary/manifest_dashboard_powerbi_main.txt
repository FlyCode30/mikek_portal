This is an Excel and Power BI based project that aims to replicate a full BI system that can create a wide variety of healthcare reports. 
This includes the BI dashboard, the data model, and a backend Excel based database that was designed with some front-end UX features in mind.<br>
The file shown here is a report for overall patient flow. The Excel backend can be viewed under Project "Files-->Implementation", as well as more reports as they are added<br><br>

The database and model design were based on an actual hospital and uses CIHI standardized codes whenever possible. <br><br>

Currently, I can only show Power BI files on my site via pictures and PDF's<br><br>
