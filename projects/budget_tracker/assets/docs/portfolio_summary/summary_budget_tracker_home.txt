This project is a budget tracker and analytical tool that can receive financial transactions, store the data using a model based on accounting principles, and then analyze that data with a BI tool. 
The Excel file located under "Project File --> Implementation" serves as the front-end UI and the primary data source, while the Power BI handles the analysis.<br><br>

The following Power BI image shown is from a mock-up, as the actual Power BI has not been completed at this point.<br><br> 

***DISCLAIMER*** - All financial data shown was generated using the help of ChatGPT, and does not reflect the personal data of any individual. <br><br>
