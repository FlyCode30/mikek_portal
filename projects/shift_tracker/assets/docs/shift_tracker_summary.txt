of creating independent reference cells instead of hard coding data, fundamental Excel formuals, and creating clarity in presenting data.

If you want to see the Excel file in its own window for better readability, you can click on the small icon at the bottom of the view window on the far right. It is called "view full-size workbook" on hovering. It will open up the file in your browser on a separate page.
